 * Given an array of positive integers representing a stockâ€™s price on each day. 
 * On each day you can only make one operation: either buy or sell one unit of stock 
 * and you can make at most 1 transaction. Determine the maximum profit you can make.

Assumptions
	
	The given array is not null and is length of at least 2.
	Examples
	
	{2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5}, the maximum profit you can make is 5 - 1 = 4
