  Given an array of positive integers representing a stockâ€™s price on each day. 
  On each day you can only make one operation: either buy or sell one unit of stock, 
  at any time you can only hold at most one unit of stock, and you can make at most
  2 transactions in total. Determine the maximum profit you can make.

	Assumptions
	
	The give array is not null and is length of at least 2
	Examples
	
	{2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 2, 11}, the maximum profit you can make is (5 - 1) + (11 - 2) = 13

/*
 * basic idea: DP
 *             traverse on each price and maintain lowest buy price and largest profit of 2 transactions
