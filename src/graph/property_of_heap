Heap: PriorityQueue in Java
      is an unsorted array but have special rules to follow
      
      Heap is implemented by constructing binary heap.
      
Properties of heap(binary heap):
	1. Any node is smaller (or greater) than all of its descendants.
	   The smallest (or greatest) element is always at root
	2. Heap is always a complete tree
	3. maxheap and minHeap
	4. assume index of parent is x then: 
       index of left_child = 2 * x + 1
       index of right_child = 2 * x + 2
    5. unsorted but follow rules above
    
Supported operations:
	insert/offer(E e): O(log(n))
	update(int index, E e): O(log(n))
	get/top(): O(1)
	pop(): O(log(n))
	heapify(int[] array): O(n)
